description: What Telegram Bot SDK is and how its packages work together
---

Telegram Bot SDK is a TypeScript toolkit for working with the Telegram Bot API. It consists of three packages that can be used independently or together.

## What you can do

**Call any Bot API method** — send messages, upload files, manage chats. You get full autocomplete for method names and parameters, and typed results with a simple `ok` / `error` shape. → [How to Use Client](/client/usage/)

**Build a bot** — define handlers for commands, text messages, and callbacks with a fluent builder API. Run it with long polling (no server needed) or webhooks. → [How to Write Bots](/bot-runner/writing-bots/)

**Use just the types** — 287 types and 165 methods, auto-generated from official Telegram docs. No runtime code, works with any HTTP client. → [API Reference](/api/)

## Packages

| Package | npm | What it does |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `@effect-ak/tg-bot-client` | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@effect-ak/tg-bot-client)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect-ak/tg-bot-client) | Type-safe client for calling Bot API methods |
| `@effect-ak/tg-bot` | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@effect-ak/tg-bot)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect-ak/tg-bot) | Bot framework with handlers, polling, and webhooks |
| `@effect-ak/tg-bot-api` | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@effect-ak/tg-bot-api)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect-ak/tg-bot-api) | TypeScript types for the entire Bot API |

The bot framework (`@effect-ak/tg-bot`) includes the client, so you only need one install if you're building a bot. Use the client package on its own for simpler use cases like sending notifications or integrating Telegram into an existing app.

## Key Features

- **Always Up-to-Date**: Types generated from official Telegram API documentation
- **Fully Type-Safe**: Complete TypeScript support for all API methods and types
- **Zero Config**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **No Webhooks Required**: Uses long polling — run anywhere without public URLs
